## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Formula One is the fastest and most watched racing series in the world. In Formula One 10 teams with two drivers and two cars each are competing to win the season by winning the most points throughout the season. There are a lot of aspects to this racing sereis since both driver, cars, mechanics, strategy and many others things are essential for a team to get points in a race. Over the past years Mercedes and Red Bull has been dominating these aspects and therefore also the sport. One race in a weekend usually consist of three practice runs on Fridays and Saturdays, three qualifying rounds on Saturdays and the final race on Sundays where  points are given to each driver. Having different drivers, driving in different cars, on different tracks gives us a lot of different data to compare and analyse. It would be interesting to see what aspects of the sport is most important to win points, who the best driver is and what the best car is. We hope to be able to present all this using a Dashboard, maybe even interactive.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We found the data on kaggle with the name "Formula 1 World Championship (1950 - 2021)". The data is compiled from the website [ergast.com](ergast.com) which provides data from Formula One all the way back to its start in 1950. The data consist of 13 csv files. Some of the more interesting are the results.csv which has all the results from all the races. The lap_times.csv contains all the laptimes for all the drivers, for all the laps for all the races. Each driver, curcuit, races, constructor and race has an id-number by which it is referenced in the other files. We would therefore have to cross reference these different files. Since the format of the races has changed over the years you might not be able ot directly compare the points gathered in one season to the amount in another. The same is true for lap times, since the cars has been slower or faster in different years. 

## Team Members

- Person 1: I love data almost as much as I love watching Formula One!
- Person 2: I am not only interested in the number of the race car!
